### Tech stack: regression, python, r

Cryptocurrencies are gaining traction as more people become interested in buying and selling them as well as understanding what exactly they are. We explored open source data sets collected from various APIs and sources to understand and answer the following questions:

* What are the factors that influence the BTC fee?
* How does the BTC fee change over time?
* Can we build a model to predict BTC fee based on the current information?


Data for blocks are collected through the Blockexplorer API. We created a Python process to extract a sample dataset from this API. The dataset contains about 6000 blocks with height(index) above 650,000. Additionally, we obtained data from blockchain.com charts, which allowed us to find snapshots of the mempool size for specific days. We then joined this data with the previous data to enhance the dataset.

## Our findings

We used a variety of regression models and included a range of selected features and data transformations. Of all of these, the clear winner seems to be the models using the Boxcox transformation of the response (R2: 0.79). We learned about the factors that determine the BTC fee includes:

* `mempool count` and `mempool size`. These two features are highly correlated (VIF > 5). Mempool_count describes the variation in fee a bit better than mempool_size does. While the mempool_size can grow from both having more transactions as well as larger transactions, mempool_count only grows when there are more transactions. We selected mempool size as the final predictor.

* `number of transactions in the current block`. This feature has high correlation with the fee (coefficient 0.45). The correlation here could be a result of the fact that when a block has more transactions in it, the competition to have a transaction included within that block is more intense. In other words, you would likely want to pay a higher fee if you wanted to have a better chance of having your transaction included in more crowded blocks.

* `max_tx_output_count` this feature describes the max of the transaction output (output is a wallet address that is receiving Satoshi for a given transaction) within the block. One thing that can happen when there are so many transactions competing is that certain services will try to confirm multiple transactions by adding them as outputs to their singular transaction. This is great! It allows one to maybe pay a little less for their transaction. But then these bundles will likely pay a higher fee, inflating the size of their block.
